//1. bind(): The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value. It letâ€™s us explicitly define the value of this when calling a function

var pokemon = {
    name: "pika",
    lastname: "chu",
    getname: function(){
        return this.name + this.lastname;
    }
}

var getPokemonName = function(){
    console.log("the name is: " + this.getname());
}

pokemonName() //VM294:11 Uncaught TypeError: this.getPokeName is not a function.

//created a new object and binds pokemon, now: this of pokemon is pokemon
var logPokemon = getPokemonName.bind(pokemon);

logPokemon(); //the name is: pikachu

/* 2. Call and apply: The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.
What that means, is that we can call any function, and explicitly specify what this should reference within the calling function. 
call() and apply() serve the exact same purpose. The only difference between how they work is that call() expects all parameters to be passed in individually, whereas apply() expects an array of all of our parameters. */

//Example 1:

var pokemon = {
    name: "pika",
    lastname: "chu",
    getname: function(){
        return this.name + this.lastname;
    }
}

var getPokemonName = function(snack, hobby){
    console.log("the name is: " + this.getname());
    console.log(this.getname() + " loves " + snack + ", " + hobby);
}

getPokemonName.apply(pokemon,["sushi","coding"]);
getPokemonName.call(pokemon, "sushi", "coding");

//Example 2:
var arr = [3,7,5,8];
Math.max.apply(Math, arr) //8;
Math.max.call(Math, 3,7,5,8); //8
