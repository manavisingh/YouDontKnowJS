//Given a bidirectional graph.Your task is to print the adjacency list for each vertex.

//Input:
//The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases.Then each of the T lines 
//contains two positive integers V and E where 'V' is the number of vertex and 'E' is number 
//of edges in graph.Next 'E' line contain two positive element showing that there is an edge 
//between these two vertex.

//Output:
//Print the list as given in example.

//Example:

//Input:
//1
//5 7
//0 1
//0 4
//1 2
//1 3
//1 4
//2 3
//3 4

//Output:
//0-> 1-> 4
//1-> 0-> 2-> 3-> 4
//2-> 1-> 3
//3-> 1-> 2-> 4
//4-> 0-> 1-> 3
